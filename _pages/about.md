Here you’ll find various things I’ve generated – research papers, random thoughts, and other creative outputs. All opinions are my own and not those of my employer or collaborators.  

**Bio:**

Mathematical elegance, figuring out how things work, and clear thinking are some of the things that interest me.

I received my B.S. and Ph.D in mathematics from Caltech and MIT. I was subsequently a Research Assistant Professor at the Simons Center for Geometry and Physics (2011-2014) and then a Visiting Assistant Professor at Michigan State University (2014-2017). During these years, my research interests expanded into high-energy physics, where I investigated mathematical problems underlying quantum field theory that have been extensively misformulated or overlooked. Most notably, my work provides a formulation of perturbative path integrals that simplifies and corrects prevailing conventional treatments, from which I proceed to clarify perturbative and nonperturbative foundations of  Yang-Mills theory that have been lacking in deeper mathematical scrutiny.

Since mid-2017, I’ve been working on machine learning in industry. Presently, I am a research software engineer at Google focused on advancing the field deep learning.
